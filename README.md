### Coding Standards

**Use Interfaces**: Define interfaces for props and state to enforce type safety and improve code readability. Interfaces should accurately describe the shape of the data being passed between components.

**Type Annotations**: Explicitly annotate types for props, state, and variables whenever possible. This helps catch type errors early in development and improves code maintainability.

**Avoid any Type**: Minimize the use of the any type as much as possible. Instead, use specific types or union types to accurately represent the data being used in your components.

**Destructuring Props**: Destructure props in function components to improve readability and avoid repetition. This makes it clear which props are being used within the component.

**Use React.FC**: Use React.FC (Function Component) type when defining functional components. This provides built-in support for specifying props and children types and improves code clarity.

These standards help ensure consistency, maintainability, and type safety in TypeScript React projects.
